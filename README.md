# ⚙️ COMP-3123 – Full Stack Development I  

Hi 👋, my name is **Prabesh Shrestha**.  
I’m currently studying **COMP-3123 (Full Stack Development I)** at **George Brown College**.  

This repository is where I will be uploading and maintaining my **lab work, assignments, and experiments** from this course. It’s mainly for my **own reference and learning**, but it also documents my progress as I explore **MERN stack development (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)**.
